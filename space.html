   <h2>Nebulas:</h2>

    <p> Nebulas are vast clouds of gas and dust in space.
     They come in various shapes and sizes and are often regions where new stars are born.
     Some famous nebulas include the Eagle Nebula (known for the Pillars of Creation) and the Orion Nebula.</p>
     <br>
   <h2>Black Holes:</h2>
   <p>Black holes are incredibly dense objects with such strong gravitational pull that nothing,
     not even light, can escape their grasp. They form from the remnants of massive stars that have undergone gravitational
      collapse. The event horizon is the boundary beyond which nothing can escape a black hole's gravity.</p>
<br>
<h2> Supernovas:</h2> 
  <p> A supernova is a powerful and explosive event that occurs during the death of massive stars. When a star 
    exhausts its nuclear fuel, it collapses under its gravity, resulting in a tremendous explosion. Supernovas release an
     enormous amount of energy and can briefly outshine an entire galaxy.</p>
<br>
 <h2> Star Formation:</h2> 
   <p>Stars form from massive clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Gravity causes these clouds
     to contract and heat up, leading to the formation of a protostar. As the protostar continues to gather mass, it becomes
      dense and hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur, igniting a new star.</p>
      <br>
   <h2> Galaxies:</h2> 
    <p>Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. There are different
     types of galaxies, including spiral galaxies (like our Milky Way), elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Galaxies can 
     contain billions to trillions of stars.</p>
     <br>
   <h2> Dark Matter and Dark Energy:</h2> 
   <p> Dark matter is an invisible and mysterious substance that accounts for a significant portion
     of the mass in the universe. Its gravitational effects can be observed, but it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. Dark
      energy, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of energy that is believed to be responsible for the accelerating expansion
       of the universe.</p>
       <Br>
   <h2>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation: </h2>
    <p>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is the faint remnant of the Big Bang,
     the event that marked the beginning of the universe. It is a uniform background radiation that permeates space and is a crucial
      piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.</p>
   <br>
   <h2>Exoplanets:</h2>
    <p> Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, some
     of which are located in the habitable zone of their star, where conditions may be suitable for liquid water and potentially life as
      we know it.</p>
      <br>
   <h2>Space Exploration:</h2>
    <p> Humans have made significant advancements in space exploration. Missions like the Apollo moon landings, the Hubble
     Space Telescope, and robotic explorations of Mars and other planets have provided us with valuable insights into the cosmos and expanded
      our understanding of the universe.</p>
      <br>
   <h2>The Age and Size of the Universe:</h2>
    <p> Scientists estimate that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, based on observations 
    of the cosmic microwave background and the rate of expansion. The observable universe is vast, with a diameter of about 93 billion light-years.</P>
